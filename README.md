# bumblebee-status-scripts
My self-made bumblebee-status scripts 

These scripts do not follow the [coding guidelines](https://bumblebee-status.readthedocs.io/en/main/development/module.html#coding-guidelines) of bumblebee-status and are quite low-quality in general to just work in my environment.  
Feel free to use them in your setup but you might have to tweak a few things.
